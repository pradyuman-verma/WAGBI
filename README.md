# WAGBI
## Future of On-Chain Lending
​
WAGBI is a money market protocol that solves the current On-Chain Lending problems using the several new technologies and primitives.
​
## Project Description 
On-Chain lending is the future. The future of lending can not be overcollateralised and capital inefficient. WAGBI provides permissionless collateralized loans expanding the use cases of borrowing and maximising capital efficiency. Current DeFi UX is complex. Simply click to supply and borrow, and earn rewards. Interact with your favorite protocols and double down on rewards and yields. Our goal is to drive DeFi’s mass adoption by providing value and great experience to all the stakeholders involved.
​
## Features
​
- Increased borrow capacity. Enabled by EIP-4337.
- Increased capital efficiency enabled by a unified liquidity pool interacting with multiple borrow markets
- Liquidators Market
- Seamless user experience
​
​
## How is it Made
​
WAGBI uses the following technologies and products:
​
- Solidity - object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts 
- Ethereum Foundation - Account Abstraction (EIP-4337) - 
- HardHat -Ethereum development environment
- React -Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript -programming language for development of large applications to JavaScript
- Polygon - Blockchain network for smart contract deployment. 
- Shardeum - Blockchain network for smart contract deployment.
- Kronos - Blockchain network for smart contract deployment.
- Quicknode - Blockchain Infrastructure provider.
- Graph - Fetching AAVE v2 data from the subgraph.
​
​
## Challenges we faced
​
While buidling WAGBI we came across a host of challenges like
​
- EIP-4337 implementation was hard due to the lack of literature available around it
- Enabling undercollateralisation was hard considering the lack of good projects around it
